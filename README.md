# Interview Prep 2026 — SQL, Python & Power BI Practice Log

A daily practice log built over 6 days to prepare for **Data Analyst interviews**.

Each day covers the same three core skills — **SQL, Python, and Power BI** — applied to a consistent synthetic e-commerce dataset containing orders and customers. The goal is to solve the same business problems (funnel conversion, customer segmentation, retention, etc.) in three different ways.

## Why This Exists

Rather than practicing SQL, Python, and Power BI in isolation, this repository tracks how the **same analytical problems can be solved across all three tools** — similar to how a real Data Analyst works.

The practice is built around problems that mirror:

* My professional experience at **GoodSpace AI**, particularly recruiter funnel analysis and reporting
* My existing projects involving **RFM segmentation**
* **E-commerce order and customer behavior analysis**
* Common Data Analyst interview questions involving SQL, Python, and Power BI

The focus is on developing **analytical thinking and tool versatility**, rather than simply memorizing syntax.

## Dataset

All exercises use the same **synthetic e-commerce dataset** consisting of:

* **846 orders**
* **300 customers**
* Varied acquisition channels
* Realistic customer purchase frequency
* Order statuses including:

  * Delivered
  * Cancelled
  * Returned

The dataset is intentionally designed to have realistic patterns, including a small number of high-frequency customers, varied acquisition sources, and different order outcomes — similar to the structure of real-world **product, growth, and e-commerce analytics data**.

Using the same dataset across multiple tools makes it possible to compare how the same business question can be approached using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Skills Covered

## Related Work

**E-commerce Order Fulfillment & Customer Behavior Analysis**
A full project referenced on my resume, focused on analyzing order fulfillment, customer behavior, and business performance using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

**Professional Experience — Data Analyst @ GoodSpace AI (Mar–Aug 2025)**

Worked on:

* Recruiter funnel analysis
* Power BI dashboards
* User engagement and platform KPIs
* Automated reporting using SQL and Python
* Analysis of behavioral patterns across 22,000+ user records

## Practice Philosophy

The goal of this repository is not to create a polished production project.

Instead, it documents **active interview preparation and daily analytical practice**.

The same business problem is intentionally approached from multiple perspectives:

```text
Business Problem
       │
       ├── SQL
       │
       ├── Python / Pandas
       │
       └── Power BI / DAX
```

This helps strengthen both **technical execution** and the ability to translate a business question into an analytical solution.

## Progress

This repository is actively being updated as part of a focused **6-day interview preparation sprint**.

Each day's commits represent the problems solved, concepts practiced, and insights generated during that day's preparation.

**Focus:** SQL • Python • Power BI • Business Analytics
**Goal:** Become faster and more confident at solving real-world Data Analyst interview problems.
